# Marketing-Analytics-Marketing-Models-Project
Mahou San Miguel, our client who sells beer products in Pernalonga stores, has hired us to verify the effectiveness of its promotions and marketing partnership with Pernalonga. We seek to identify promotion and marketing activities that drive significant incremental sales for continuation into 2018.

Our Marketing Model will consider weekly sales volume, for each San Miguel product, for the
following components: Base, Shelf Price, Discount, Flyer, Store Display, Email, Web Search,
Paid Search, and TV.
